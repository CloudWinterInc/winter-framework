Winter framework
================

A professional Java enterprise framework designed and built for Google App Engine.

We don't want to re-invent the wheel so we use some of the defacto-libraries used in GAE projects:
* Objectify
* Guice
* Guava libraries
* Gson
* Maven
* Velocity Templates for mails
* Hibernate Validations
* Shiro for security

It provides to you:
* An easy to work Rest API. 
* A complete task management module for common development tasks (Initial Data setup, Dummy Data, Index fixes, Wipe data).
* A complete email system using tasks, with velocity templates. 
* A common way to throw handle exceptions & custom errors.
* A built-in audit module.
* An simple security with users/roles for authentication.
* Integrations with social networks.  
* Integrations with payments platforms.
